This assumes that one uses an ordinary network calble to connect from the esp32 board to the sp30 board.
The network cable has stiped and non-striped versions of blue, orange, green, and brown.

Pin 1 - Orange     - Not used
Pin 2 - 1/2 Orange - Not used
Pin 3 - Blue
	  - Connected to a 1kOmh resistor and then to optocoupler 3 in
	  - Connected to a diode and then to relay 3 out
	Function:
Pin 4 - 1/2 Blue
	  - Connected to 1,2,3 ground out
	  Function: This is the ground of the live wires which are used to register a pushed button
Pin 5 - Green
	  - Connected to a 2.2 kOhm resistor and then to relay 2 out
	  - Connected to a 1 kOhm resistor ant then to optocoupler 2 in
	  Function:
Pin 6 1/2 Green
	  - Connected to a 2.2 kOhm resistor and then to relay 2 out
	  - Connected to a 1 kOhm resistor ant then to optocoupler 2 in
	   Function 
Pin 7 - Brown
	  - Connected to optocoupler ground in
      Function: Provide negative pole for the optocoupler
Pin 8 - 1/2 Brown Not used
