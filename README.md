Connect the three 3 V relays to the Z-UNO:
- Z-UNO, pin  9: to relay 1 in
- Z-UNO, pin 10: to relay 2 in
- Z-UNO, pin 11: to relay 3 in
- 3V to relay Vin
- GND to relay GND-in

Connect the three 3 V relays to the SP425:
- SP425, pin 4: to relay 1,2,3 GND-out
- SP425, pin 5: to relay 1 out 
- SP425, pin 6: to relay 2 out 
- SP425, pin 7: to relay 3 out 

Connect a RJ45 wire to the breadboard and optocouplers
- wire pin 5: with a 1 kΩ resistor to optocoupler 1 input 
- wire pin 6: with a 1 kΩ resistor to optocoupler 2 input 
- wire pin 3: with a 1 kΩ resistor to optocoupler 3 input 
- wire pin 7: to optocoupler 1,2,3 GND-in 

Connect the three optocouplers to the Z-UNO:
- optocoupler 1 out: to Z-UNO, pin A1
- optocoupler 2 out: to Z-UNO, pin A2
- optocoupler 3 out: to Z-UNO, pin A3
- optocoupler 1,2,3 GND-out: with 1 kΩ resistors to GND

Connect the four DS18B20 temperature sensors to the Z-UNO:
- Z-UNO, pin 12: to DS18B20 data pin
- 4.7 kΩ pullup resistor for DS18B20 data pin
- 5V to DS18B20 5V pins
- GND to DS18B20 GND pins

Connect the SP425 to the SP30 and the fan ("aggregat"):
- connect the RJ45 splitter to the SP425 "aggregat" connector
- connect the fan ("aggregat") to the RJ45 splitter
- connect the RJ45 wire connected to the breadboard to the RJ45 splitter
- connect the SP30 wire to the SP425 "Styrepanel SP 30" connector

Connect power to the Z-UNO:
- Z-UNO, USB: power source
- Z-UNO, GND


### Firmware

Upload to Z-UNO by:

- install the Z-UNO software version 2.1.5 for Arduino.  See '[here](https://z-uno.z-wave.me/install)' for instructions.
- upload '[firmware](https://github.com/balmli/no.almli.flexit.zuno/blob/master/Flexit_SP30_ZUNO/Flexit_SP30_ZUNO.ino)'.
